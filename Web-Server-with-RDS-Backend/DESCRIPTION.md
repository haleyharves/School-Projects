This was a midterm project for my Cloud Computing class. We worked on AWS accounts in order to host and create
a database for this web server to access. I was inspired by the app Letterboxd and wanted to make my own personal
version on a website. This was a very fun and rewarding project for me and I had a lot of fun creating it.
